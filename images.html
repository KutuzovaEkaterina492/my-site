    It is medium-sized, characterized by a large but short muzzle, a flat forked nose, and a wide forked upper lip. Erect ears, wide at the base and rounded at the top. The protruding brow ridges are separated from each other by a deep groove between the eyes. The furrow should not continue on the forehead, as in English bulldogs. The occipital protuberance is poorly developed[1]. They can have the most diverse color: brindle, white-brindle, fawn, white-fawn. Cream color is not recognized by the breed standards of the FCI (European Cynological Federation) and the RKF, but is widespread in America.
